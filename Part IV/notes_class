El Gamal Encryotion Scheme 

{G,g,n} where G is a cyclic group, G = <g> and n = |G|.


We will have G= (Z/p)*  ( this prime has to be bigger to get the same encryption power as the elyptic curve one)
, remember this is always cyclic

or G = E(Z/p) 


You : pick random (private) d belongs to Z/n (public)            Athena

compute h=g^d                                                   To encrypt m belongs to G
                                                                Choose r belongs to Z/n
                                                                Compute C1=g^r
                                                                Compute c2=h^r*m
                         (c1,c2)       <----------------------
decrypt: compute c2 c1  ^-d = h^r*m(g^r)^-decrypt=(g^d)^r * m(g^r)^-d = g^dr * m g ^-dr = m  
something about I2OSP    



Let E be an elliptic curve over FZ/p where p is prime. Hiw ca n we findnpoints on E?
Define by an equation y^2= xx^3+ax+b   a, b in F.

{ f(x) | w in F}  suppose = {5f(17)   5f(100)}

                                E(17,+-3) 

{y^2 | y in F}    suppose = {5} ( and let 5= 3^2)
