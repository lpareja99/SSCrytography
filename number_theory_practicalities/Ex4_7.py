 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EXERCISE 4: Write a program that verifies that the expected number of tries before your prime
    generating function returns a 200-bit prime is about 200*ln(2)/2 is approx 69.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EXERCISE 7:(Optional) Write a program that displays the sampling distribution for the number of
     tries before finding a prime using the method outlined above. The mean and standard 
     deviation should both be about 69.


    Notes: Use numpy to do the calculations of avg and std. I used pandas to plot because it's 
    how I'm used to do it from Data Analitics, but there is probably an easier way.
