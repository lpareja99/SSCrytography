    1&2) Solving Additive Groups  (n * x =  a in Z/p)                   LEVEL 1
        * There is always a solution *
       
        n = 11
        a = 30                                              a is relatively prime to p
        p = 43 // use prime number                          p = prime number
        F = nl.Zmodp(p) // makes sure p is prime            F = field (ring where every non zero has a multiplicative)

    3&4) Solving Multiplicative Groups ( 543**x = 12 in (Z/547)* )      LEVEL 2
        * First we need to check if there is a possible solution *
        * We need a generator to make sure we have a solution *

        for x in range (p):                                 we need to brutforce it, we can not calculate the inverse directly

    5&6) Solving Elliptic Curves:                                       LEVEL 3

        p = 37
        F = nl.Zmodp(p, negatives = True)                   Field including negatives values
        q = F(5)                                           q value in elliptic curve function
        r = F(13)                                           r value in elliptic curve function
        E =  nl.EllCurve(q,r, debug = True)                  E = elliptic curve (x,y) e (z/47)x(Z/47)
        
        E(1,2)                                              error because P(1,2) is not in the elliptic curve
        len(list(nl.affine(E)))                             return order of the group - 1 (ifinity point)
        E(4,19)*0                                           [0: 1: 0] point of infinity or identity element, it has the elemeny insteal of 2
        assert E.disc != 0, "curve is singular"

        P = E(12, 5)                                         pt that it is generator in the elliptic curve
        Q = E(-6, 10)                                        second point also in the elliptic curve

        for x in range(42):                                 we go up to the order
            if x*P == Q:
                print(x)                                    22

        for pt in nl.affine(E):                             return all point in the curve except of the infinity one
            print (pt, nl.addorder(pt))                     print point and its order

        print(E.disc)


        E(4,28) + E(7,33)                                   addition of two pt on the elliptic curve 
    

Ellipic Curve over Z/47:
    - y**2 = x**3 + qx + r                                 shape of the elliptic curve overall
    - P = (1,2)
    - 4 == (1+40+43) mod 47? --> 4 =/= 37                  P is not in the elliptic curve 
    - E has 49 elements
    - We do not knwo if it has a solution, we need to knwo if it has a generator.
    - (x,y) in FxF
    - E(13,9) + E(13,-9) = [0:1:0]                         point of infinity or identy
    - P + Q = R beacuse P + Q + R = 0
    - P + P takes the tangent line in the elliptic curve
    - Every elliptic curve should have 3 distict point with the same order. 
      if there is only two, one of them most be a double root. Thet means there is 
      a singularity in th eelliptic curve.
    - There are more than 3 points with the highest order. 
    - 

                                    IMPORTANT NOTE
*** Every elliptic curve turn to be a cyclic group or a product of an elliptic curve ***
* A real elliptic curve has more points than we can print
